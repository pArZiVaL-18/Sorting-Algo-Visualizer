# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a web-based application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It allows users to select various sorting algorithms and watch the sorting process unfold step-by-step with visual animations.

# Features
**Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Includes Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.<br/>
**Interactive Visualization:** Watch the sorting process in real-time with animations. <br/>
**Play Again:** Replay the sorting process on the same array. <br/>
**Random Array Generation:** Generate a new random array of numbers to sort. <br/>
**Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices. <br/>

# Technologies Used
**HTML -** Structure of the web pages <br/>
**CSS -** Styling and animations <br/>
**JavaScript -** Application logic and sorting algorithms <br/>

# How It Works
**Select an Algorithm:** Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu. <br/>
**Generate a Random Array:** Click the "New" button to create a new random array. <br/>
**Start Sorting:** Click the "Start" button to visualize the sorting process. <br/>
**Replay:** After the sorting completes, click the "Again" button to replay the animation on the same array.<br/>
