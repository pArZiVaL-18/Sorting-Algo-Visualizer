# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a web-based application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It allows users to select various sorting algorithms and watch the sorting process unfold step-by-step with visual animations.

# Features
**Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Includes Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
**Interactive Visualization:** Watch the sorting process in real-time with animations.
**Play Again:** Replay the sorting process on the same array.
**Random Array Generation:** Generate a new random array of numbers to sort.
**Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Technologies Used
**HTML -** Structure of the web pages
**CSS -** Styling and animations
**JavaScript -** Application logic and sorting algorithms
