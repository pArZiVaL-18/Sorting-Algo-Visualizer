            <div class="definition">
                <i><u>Selection Sort</u></i> is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two portions: the sorted portion and the unsorted portion. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. This process continues until the entire list becomes sorted.

                    <li>Start with the entire unsorted list.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n²), where ’n’ is the number of elements in the list. </li>
                    <li>This quadratic time complexity makes it less efficient than other sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, for large datasets. </li>
                    <li>However, selection sort has a space complexity of O(1) since it operates directly on the input array without requiring additional memory.</li>

            <div class="explaination">
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the significant strengths of selection sort is its simplicity.</li>
                    <li> It is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for educational purposes or situations where a simple sorting algorithm is required. </li>
                    <li>Selection sort also performs well on small datasets or partially sorted lists, as it minimizes the number of swaps required. </li>
                    <li>However, selection sort’s main limitation is its efficiency for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.</li>
