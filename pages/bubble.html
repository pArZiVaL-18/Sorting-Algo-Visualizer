                <i><u>Bubble Sort</u></i> is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
            </div>

            <div class="title"><span class="title-1">Steps on how it works :</span></div>
            <div class="working"> 
                <ol>
                    <li>In an unsorted array of 5 elements, start with the first two elements and sort them in ascending order. (Compare the element to check which one is greater).</li>
                    <li>Compare the second and third element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.</li>
                    <li>Compare the third and fourth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.</li>
                    <li>Compare the fourth and fifth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 1–5 until no more swaps are required.</li>

            <div class="characteristics">
                <ul>
                    <li>Large values are always sorted first.</li>
                    <li>It only takes one iteration to detect that a collection is already sorted.</li>
                    <li>The best time complexity for Bubble Sort is O(n). The average and worst time complexity is O(n²).</li>
                    <li>The space complexity for Bubble Sort is O(1), because only single additional memory space is required.</li>
                </ul>

                Overall Bubble Sort is an important concept to understand when it comes to algorithms.
